# Data Science

### Big Data

Extremely large data sets that may be analysed computationally
to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating
to human behaviour and interactions.

### Machine Learning

Method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea
that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions
with minimal human intervention.

### Artificial Intelligence

Term for simulated intelligence in machines.
These machines are programmed to "think" like a human
and mimic the way a person acts.
