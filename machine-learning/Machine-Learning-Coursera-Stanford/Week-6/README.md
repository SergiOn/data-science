### Evaluating a Learning Algorithm

#### Evaluating a Hypothesis

Evaluating a Hypothesis
Once we have done some trouble shooting for errors in our predictions by:

Getting more training examples
Trying smaller sets of features
Trying additional features
Trying polynomial features
Increasing or decreasing Î»
We can move on to evaluate our new hypothesis.

A hypothesis may have a low error for the training examples but still be inaccurate (because of overfitting).
Thus, to evaluate a hypothesis, given a dataset of training examples,
we can split up the data into two sets: a training set and a test set.
Typically, the training set consists of 70 % of your data and the test set is the remaining 30 %.

#### Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets

Just because a learning algorithm fits a training set well, that does not mean it is a good hypothesis.
It could over fit and as a result your predictions on the test set would be poor.
The error of your hypothesis as measured on the data set with which you trained the parameters will be lower than the error on any other data set.

Given many models with different polynomial degrees, we can use a systematic approach to identify the 'best' function.
In order to choose the model of your hypothesis, you can test each degree of polynomial and look at the error result.

One way to break down our dataset into the three sets is:
* Training set: 60%
* Cross validation set: 20%
* Test set: 20%
